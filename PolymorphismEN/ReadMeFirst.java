    What is Polymorphism?

    Polymorphism, meaning "many forms," refers to the ability of an object to behave in multiple ways.
    It is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) and enhances flexibility
    and code reusability in software development.

    Main Goals of Polymorphism:
    - Allow the same operation to behave differently for different objects.
    - Simplify code maintenance and extension.
    - Enable more functionality with less code.

    --------------------------------------------
    Types of Polymorphism:
    --------------------------------------------

    1. Compile-time Polymorphism:
        - Compile-time Polymorphism is determined during the compilation phase of the program.
        - It occurs when methods with the same name are defined with different parameter lists.
        - This is achieved in Java through **Method Overloading**.
        
        Key Features:
        - Method names are identical, but parameters differ in type, order, or count.
        - Improves code readability.
        - Resolved at compile-time.

    2. Run-time Polymorphism:
        - Run-time Polymorphism is determined during the runtime of the program.
        - It occurs when a subclass redefines a method that is already defined in its superclass.
        - This is achieved in Java through **Method Overriding**.
        
        Key Features:
        - The overridden method in the subclass must match the method signature in the superclass.
        - Decides which method to invoke at runtime.
        - Involves inheritance and dynamic binding.

    --------------------------------------------
    Key Rules in Run-time Polymorphism:
    --------------------------------------------
    - The overridden method in the subclass must have the exact same signature as the one in the superclass.
    - The access modifier of the subclass method cannot be more restrictive than the superclass method.
    - If a method in the superclass is declared `final` or `static`, it cannot be overridden.

    --------------------------------------------
    Benefits:
    --------------------------------------------
    - Increases code flexibility: The same method can exhibit different behaviors for different objects.
    - Simplifies code reuse: General behaviors can be defined in the superclass, while specific behaviors are implemented in subclasses.
    - Supports runtime decisions through dynamic binding.

    --------------------------------------------
    Use Cases of Polymorphism:
    --------------------------------------------
    - Defining methods with shared behavior across multiple classes.
    - Building dynamic structures that work with different objects seamlessly.
    - Enhancing code extensibility.

    Note: Polymorphism is often used alongside inheritance and interfaces.
